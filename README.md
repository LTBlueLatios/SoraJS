> ## Sora is being paused for maintenance.

> I am continuing to work on Sora.js, but for the meantime, all Github activities are paused since it causes unneccessary complications. I'll commit all changes when I consider Sora officially complete. I will also be resetting all module semantic versions, so all modules will become 1.0.0.
