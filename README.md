# Sora
A library of functional modules made to suit the needs of it's developer. Follows the principles of "small but mighty" and coded in pure Javascript.

## Sora is being paused for maintenance. 

As the days go by, I am slowly integrating more and more philosophy into this project. Sora.js is going through a massive reform, however it's core philosophy will stay to its true core. The release will be underwhelming due to its fundamental nature. Each module is made to be a solution-agnostic tool that isn't anything in its current state, but has the potential to be an incredibly impactful tool when used well.

## Warning

If you're a person who codes in step by step instructions or thinks in a linear model (ex: computer scientist, normal developer aka not a software engineer), this library is not for you. Do not use it, it's very easy to land in a pitfall if you do. I'll create a translation of conceptual abstractions down to linear models when this library fully completed.
