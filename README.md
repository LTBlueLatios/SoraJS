# Sora

A library of highly specialised and systemically designed modules made to be solution-agnostic.

## Description

A personal library of mines to showcase my growth and knowledge within several programming aspects.
Don't get the wrong idea though, I still use this library as it's a very important foundation
for all my projects. This library also serves as the source for the SoraJS architeciture and other relevant
programming styles that I use. Most of the things in this library is mostly just dumps and references
for myself; these are stripped from the main npm package.

You're free to use this library, simply respect the license and understand
and that this library was engineered for myself and how I see the world of programming (from my perspective
as a person with autism and ADHD).

> [!CAUTION]
> SoraJS is in development and is not suitable for production use.
