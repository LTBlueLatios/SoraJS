# Sora

A library of highly specialised modules made to be solution-agnostic tools. Make the right way the easy way.

## Sora is being paused for maintenance

As the days go by, I am slowly integrating more and more philosophy into this project. Sora.js is going through a massive reform, however it's core philosophy true to its core. Each module is made to be a solution-agnostic tool that isn't anything in its current state, but has the potential to be an incredibly impactful tool.

## Warning

If you're a person who codes in step by step instructions or thinks in a linear model (ex: computer scientist, normal developer aka not a software engineer, etc.), this library is not for you. It's recommended to not use it, it's very easy to land in a pitfall if you do. I'll create a translation of high level, abstracted concepts down to low level, linear models when this library is fully completed. Though, to be honest, the best solution is that your software engineer already did this task for you.
